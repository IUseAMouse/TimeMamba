**TimeMamba** is a PyTorch implementation of the Mamba state space model for time series forecasting. It leverages the powerful Mamba architecture to provide efficient and accurate predictions for time series data with O(n) memory complexity.

## Features

I am currently working towards these features :

- ðŸš€ **Efficient Implementation**: Optimized for both memory usage and speed using selective state space models
- ðŸ“ˆ **Time Series Forecasting**: Direct multi-step forecasting for various horizons
- ðŸ”Œ **PyTorch Lightning Integration**: Easy training, validation, and testing with built-in best practices
- ðŸ§© **Extensible Architecture**: Modular design that can be easily adapted for different time series tasks

## Installation

TimeMamba uses [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for dependency management for faster and more reliable Python package handling.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
